* paths to the compiler binaries in the spec2006/pisa.cgf file are set to SS's version of gcc compiler(2.7.2.3)
* Commands to install and run SPEC2006 (without runspec)
	* Extract SPEC source files and cd into it
	* ./install.sh -d <destination directory for installation>	
	* The script should automatically select the best config match, else choose
	* Post installation, goto installation directory and run
		. ./shrc
	* How the environment is set: use the "go" command to navigate through SPEC
	  (go top, go <benchmark_name> etc.)
	* Clone a config file from root_dir/configs/ and edit it as needed (use different
	  compiler binaries, for example)
	* Run the following to setup the benchmark directories without actually installing
		runspec --fake --loose --size test --tune base --config pisa.cfg bwaves
	* Now got build directory using
		go bwaves
		cd build/build_*something*here*/
	* At this point, if the config file is correctly setup, simple run
		specmake clean
		specmake

	  Else, to manually run each command to build the benchmark, run
		specmake -n
	  This prints out the commands without executing them
	* Next goto ../../run/run*something*here*/
	* In this folder, we run the benchmark. The binary from the build directory needs
	  to be copied here with  a specific name. To get the name, run
		specinvoke -n
	* Copy the benchmark binary from ../../build/build*something*here*/
	* The above command also prints out the manual command for running the benchmark
